This repo was built during a 2 day case study with a team of four from Data Science Immersive course at Galvanize. Together we developed a model for fraud detection of events hosted by Eventbright. We used a stacked model with Natural Language Processing of the event description fed into a Random Forest Classifier stacked onto a xgboost model of additional engineered features. We developed a proof of concept web application which was able to reguest data from a new event url and return the predicted probability that this new event was fraudulent. The data was stored in a MongoDb database and the history of event predictions is available to the user. 

This is a very basic application developed in 2 days. We all hope to spend a day cleaning up the app and implimentation after we finish our capstone projects. Check back for more later!
